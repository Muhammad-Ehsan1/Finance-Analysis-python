# Finance-Analysis-python
This project explores financial data using Python, focusing on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to uncover investment trends and insights. Using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I processed financial datasets, analyzed investment patterns, and visualized key financial metrics. The analysis provides valuable insights into market trends, asset performance, and investment behaviors, helping in data-driven financial decision-making. This project demonstrates my expertise in data analytics, financial insights, and visualization techniques
